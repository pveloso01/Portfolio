    "longDescription": "Comprehensive energy market prediction platform developed as my Master's thesis project. The system analyzes day-ahead and intraday energy markets using advanced machine learning models to provide accurate predictions for market participants.\n\nThe platform features a sophisticated contract-decision engine that helps energy traders make informed decisions based on market predictions. I implemented a complete production-grade data pipeline following MLOps best practices, including automated model retraining, version control with DVC, experiment tracking with MLflow, and continuous deployment through GitHub Actions.\n\nThe technical architecture leverages LightGBM for gradient boosting, Prophet for time series forecasting, and SARIMAX for statistical modeling. The backend API is built with FastAPI for high-performance predictions, while PostgreSQL handles data persistence and historical analysis.",
